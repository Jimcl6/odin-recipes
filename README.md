# First Odin Project

This is an Odin Project

## Getting Started

This project will serve as my practice project towards my progress with my HTML knowledge by buildinga basic recipe website.

The websiite will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won't look very pretty by the time I've finished, but it's important to keep in mind that this project is to just build my HTML chops; this will be revisited in the future to style it up with CSS.
